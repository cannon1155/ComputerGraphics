You should keep your parser as simple as possible - remember this unit is about graphical rendering, not parsing data. Only implement the aspects of the OBJ file format that you need to complete the task at hand. Your parser will not be marked - it is just a means to an end (to allow you to incorporate complex models and to provide you with familiarity of geometry storage and retrieval).
