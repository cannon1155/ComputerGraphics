Now that you know how to project individual vertices from a 3D model on the image plane, the next step is to produce a "wireframe" render of the Cornell Box model. The basic principle is to create an equivalent 2D `CanvasTriangle` for each 3D `ModelTriangle` found in the model. You can then reuse your 2D stroked triangle drawing function that you wrote in the previous workbook to create the final "wireframe" render. If everything works out OK, you should get a wireframe render that looks something like the image below.
