After you have successfully rendered a wireframe of the model, the next step is to fill those triangles ! This is going to be easier than you might think !!! The image panel is 2D and you have already written a 2D "filled triangle" rasterising function in a previous workbook. Make sure you use the correct colours to fill the triangles (namely the colours that you read in from the materials file and stored in your palette). The end product of drawing the filled triangles of the Cornell Box should look something like the image below.
